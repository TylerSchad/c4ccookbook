# c4ccookbook

Our school dining hall, known as the C4C, provides various food options across a variety of stations.
However, the student population still gets sick of the selection, considering it rarely varies throughout the year.
This website allows people to fill out a form online and submit their recipes for special creations they make to mix it up.
Every submission is sorted into categories, and people can then go to the website to look for new food ideas.

This website was made by me over a weekend for HackCU, a hackathon through Major-League Hacking.
It uses JavaScript to write data to Firebase, an online database for API storage.
